# THIS IS A README

## YOU READ IT

Reading it provides you with valuable information about the project. For example, this project was written by Lawrence E. Leclercq in June, 2014. It's a game about killing all your friends.
That's actually a lie.  They're clearly ok if they can say something after the fight is over.

## IT TELLS YOU STUFF

This game depends on:

* Python 2
* Pygame

## ALSO IT'S IN MARKDOWN

Markdown is cool.

## SOMETIME IT HAS A LICENSE

Like GPLv2, the best license.
