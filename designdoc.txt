Flow of combat:

____ is attacking!

Attack Magic Taunt?(Some third Option) Run (which just ends the game)

IF they pick the frist, show text from a list describing the attack 
and deal damage to the enemy.

or

If they pick the second option, display magicks
User uses magic, which can damage the enemy or heal the user

enemy then attacks/uses magic

reprint current health and combat options

if health <= 0 
    go to continue screen. if continue, restart fight with full stats. else, end game

if enemy health <= 0,
    death quote plays, maybe some inbetween text, then intro of next enemy plays

Lucas = Enemy(5, 5, 1  <---- bad idea; cant use ai that way



How's the engine work?

Print "%s is attacking!" %Enemy.name
Print "What will you do?"
Print "[A]ttack [M]agic M[y]stery [R]un"
action = raw_input("> ")
if action == "a" or "A" or "attack" or "Attack":
    Hero.attack(Enemy)   


luke_stats = {'name': 'Lucas', 'hp': 40, 'mp': 5, 'atkstr': 1, 'intro_quote': 'Wubalubadubdub!', 'outro_quote': 'My leg!'}
luke_quotes = ['Lucas complains at you until your ears bleed!','Lucas beaches you to death!']
Lucas = Character(luke_stats, luke_quotes)


Class Character(object)

    def __init__(self, stats, battle_quotes):
        self.lvl = 1
        self.name = stats['name']
        self.hp = stats['hp']
        self.mp = stats['mp']
        self.atkstr = stats['atkstr']
        self.quips = battle_quotes

    def attack(self, opponent):
        print self.quips[randint(0, len(self.quips) - 1)]
        opponent.hp -= self.atkstr

need to flesh out magic more
